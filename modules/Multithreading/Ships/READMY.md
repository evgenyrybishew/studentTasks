Ships
On one side there is one big pot. This port can generate ships with different type of goods. On other side there are 
ports, which can accept goods only one type.
And between big port and small ports there is bottleneck(narrow place) and only one ship can go thru this place in one 
moment of time. But all ships are hurry.
